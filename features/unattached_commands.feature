Feature: Command behaviour when unattached

    Scenario Outline: Unattached auto-attach does nothing in a ubuntu machine
        Given a `<release>` machine with ubuntu-advantage-tools installed
        When I verify that running `ua auto-attach` `as non-root` exits `1`
        Then stderr matches regexp:

            This command must be run as root \(try using sudo\)
