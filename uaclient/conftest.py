    """A fixture that returns a function that returns caplog.text

    caplog isn't available in pytest in all of our target releases; this either
    uses caplog.text if available, or a shim which replicates what it does.

    Specifically, bionic is the first Ubuntu release to contain a version of
    pytest new enough for the caplog fixture to be present.  In xenial, the
    python3-pytest-catchlog package provides the same functionality (this is
    the code that was later integrated in to pytest).  For trusty, there is no
    packaged alternative to this shim.

    (It returns a function so that the requester can decide when to examine the
    logs; if it returned caplog.text directly, that would always be empty.)
